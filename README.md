In my capacity as a freelance professional, I undertook an project.
The task involved the seamless integration of data from a database onto an image,
culminating in the production of elegantly designed diplomas for a prestigious
educational institution. The automation of diploma delivery via email to recipient
listed in the same database.

Notably, this was a repeat order from a satisfied customer for whom I had previously
delivered work. It was a pleasure to work with them once again.
